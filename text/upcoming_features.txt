* Expected Features in Future StateS Versions *
***********************************************

These features will be implemented... some day.

** Interface **

- Full rebuild of simulation timeline, current behavior is too basic,
- Support hexadecimal notation for bit vector variables,
- Allow custom path for graphic transitions instead of only straight lines and Bezier.

** Core **

- Apply the notion of memorized variable to the variable itself instead of determining if from the action type,
- Integer type variables support,
- Variable to variable affectation, instead of just constant.


** Long-term **

- Ability to save/load timeline, and load stimuli vector,
- Textual equations edition,
- Truth-table based equation edition,
- Grafcet-type machines.


** Very long-term **

- Petri Nets support,
- Support a coupling interface to send outputs/receive inputs from another software (or more generally, another environment -- hardware?).
