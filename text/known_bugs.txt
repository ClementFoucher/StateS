* StateS v. 0.3.B Known Bugs *
******************************


// The following behaviors are known:

- Time line PDF export creates heavy, slow and ugly PDF (unlike machine PDF export),
- Biggest transition selection box hides smaller transitions when multiple transitions between states,
- Escape key has to be pushed twice to cancel signal creation/edition,
- Pressing F2 key on a signal in signal editor allows to edit content, but edition is actually ignored,
- When adding a signal, tab key causes inconsistent behavior,
- Ctrl+s shortcurt may not be handled when focus is on a list,
- A signal can only be added once in an action list => unable to assign multiple ranges simultaneously,
- Active on state signals on initial state: timeline do not show this action if we change state at first clock cycle.


// VHDL export issues:

- Output generation is very partially implemented!
-> Sub-range adressed signals are ignored,
-> Signals mixing maintained values (set, reset, affect) and transitory values (active on state, pulse) are ignored,
-> Signals mixing Moore and Mealy behaviors are ignored,
-> Mealy signals maintaining value (set, reset, affect) are ignored.

=> Thus currently, the only handled outputs are:
-> Moore-only, transitory values only, fully affected outputs,
-> Moore-only, maintained values only, fully affected outputs,
-> Mealy-only, transitory values only, fully affected outputs.


// Not bugs, but still:

- Straight line transitions selection is only done by clicking exactly on the line, so very difficult to catch,
- No undo!
