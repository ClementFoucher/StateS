* StateS v. 0.3.G Known Bugs *
******************************


// The following behaviors are known:

- Time line PDF export creates heavy, slow and ugly PDF (unlike machine PDF export),
- Pressing F2 key on a signal in signal editor allows to edit content, but edition is actually ignored,
- A signal can only be added once in an action list => unable to assign multiple ranges simultaneously,
- Active on state signals on initial state: timeline do not show this action if we change state at first clock cycle.
- Export to PDF has incorrect margins.

// VHDL export issues:

- Output generation is very partially implemented!
-> Sub-range adressed signals are ignored,
-> Signals mixing maintained values (set, reset, affect) and transitory values (active on state, pulse) are ignored,
-> Signals mixing Moore and Mealy behaviors are ignored,
-> Mealy signals maintaining value (set, reset, affect) are ignored.

=> Thus currently, the only handled outputs are:
-> Moore-only, transitory values only, full-range affected outputs,
-> Moore-only, maintained values only, full-range affected outputs,
-> Mealy-only, transitory values only, full-range affected outputs.


// Not bugs, but still:

- No undo!
