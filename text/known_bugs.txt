* StateS v. 0.4.5 Known Issues *
********************************


** The following behaviors are known: **

- Time line PDF export creates heavy, slow and ugly PDF (unlike machine PDF export),
- Pressing F2 key on a signal in signal editor allows to edit content, but edition is actually ignored,
- Export to PDF has incorrect margins.


** VHDL export issues: **

- Output generation is very partially implemented!
-> Sub-range adressed signals are ignored,
-> Signals mixing maintained values (set, reset, affect) and transitory values (active on state, pulse) are ignored,
-> Signals mixing Moore and Mealy behaviors are ignored,
-> Mealy signals maintaining value (set, reset, affect) are ignored.

=> Thus currently, the only handled outputs are:
-> Moore-only, transitory values only, full-range affected outputs,
-> Moore-only, maintained values only, full-range affected outputs,
-> Mealy-only, transitory values only, full-range affected outputs.
