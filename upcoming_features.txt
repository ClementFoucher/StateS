* Expected Features in Future StateS Versions *
***********************************************

These features will be implemented... some day.

** Interface **

- Full rebuild of simulation window, current behavior is too basic,
- Support of hexadecimal notation for bit vector signals,
- Textual equations edition.

** Core **

- Integer type signals support, allowing basic operations like increment.

** Long-term **

- Ability to save/load timeline, and load stimuli vector,
- Grafcet-type machines.

** Very long-term **

- Support a coupling interface to send outputs/receive inputs from another software (or more generally, another environment -- hardware?),
