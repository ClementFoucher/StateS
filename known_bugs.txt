* StateS v. 0.3.10 Known Bugs *
*******************************

// The following behaviors are known:

- Time line PDF export creates heavy, slow and ugly PDF (unlike machine PDF export),
- Biggest transition selection box hides smaller transitions when multiple transitions between states,
- Escape key has to be pushed twice to cancel signal creation/edition,
- Pressing F2 key on a signal in signal editor allows to edit content, but edition is actually ignored,
- When adding a signal, tab key causes inconsistent behavior,
- Ctrl+s shortcurt may not be handled when focus is on a list,
- A signal can only be added once in an action list => unable to assign multiple ranges simultaneously,
- Active on state signals on initial state: timeline do not show this action if we change state at first clock cycle.

// VHDL export issues:

- Active on state state and pulse signals are not correctly handled in VHDL export: signal value is maintained,
- Actions on transitions are ignored when FSM is exported to VHDL,
- Multiple "_" can be generated in a row in a VHDL signal name, which is not a correct syntax,
- Concatenate and extract operation not handled.

// Not bugs, but still:

- Straight line transitions selection is only done by clicking exactly on the line, so very difficult to catch,
- No undo!
