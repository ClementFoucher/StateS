*****************

// The following behaviors are known.
// They may be buggy, or just uninmplemented code.

- Time line PDF export creates heavy, slow and ugly PDF (unlike machine PDF export),
- Simulator does not check for transition exclusive conditions, it just takes the firt available transition with true condition,
- Begin/end simulation: conditions only containing constants: color is not updated,
- Problem when error on rename signal (red), then begin other action while not resolving error,
- Biggest transition selection box hides smaller transitions when multiple transitions between states.

// Not bugs, but still

- Transition selection box for straight lines is only on line, so very difficult to catch,
- Context menu when simulating should change with appropriate options: force state activation,
- Allow cancel renaming/adding signals while editing not validated,
- Display current state on simu (add tooltip),
- Should not allow to stack states (ugly state/transition stacking).
