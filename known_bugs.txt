// The following behaviors are known.
// They may be buggy, or just uninmplemented code.

- Time line PDF export creates heavy, slow and ugly PDF (unlike machine PDF export),
- Begin/end simulation: color update is not complete,
- Problem when error on rename signal (red), then begin other action while not resolving error,
- Biggest transition selection box hides smaller transitions when multiple transitions between states,
- Active on state state and pulse signals are not correctly handled in VHDL export: signal value is maintained,
- Actions on transitions are ignored when FSM is exported to VHDL,
- Multiple "_" can be generated in a row in a VHDL signal name, which is not a correct syntax,

// Not bugs, but still

- Transition selection for straight lines is only done by clicking exactly on the line, so very difficult to catch,
- Should allow cancel renaming/adding signals while editing not validated.
