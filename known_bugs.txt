*****************

// The following behaviors are known.
// They may be buggy, or just uninmplemented code.

- Time line PDF export creates heavy, slow and ugly PDF (unlike machine PDF export),
- Begin/end simulation: conditions only containing constants/state actions: color is not updated,
- Problem when error on rename signal (red), then begin other action while not resolving error,
- Biggest transition selection box hides smaller transitions when multiple transitions between states,
- Active on state state and pulse signals are not correctly handled in VHDL export: signal value is maintained,
- Actions on transitions are ignored when FSM is exported to VHDL,
- Multiple "_" can be generated in a VHDL signal name, which is not a correct syntax,
- A delay is added between clock and output generation in simulation => should be optional.

// Not bugs, but still

- Transition selection box for straight lines is only on line, so very difficult to catch,
- Context menu when simulating should change with appropriate options: force state activation,
- Should allow cancel renaming/adding signals while editing not validated,
- Should display current state on simu (add tooltip),
- Should not allow to stack states (ugly state/transition stacking),
- Sould support box selection on scene,
- Time line window should use a scroll bar when too much variables,
- Should be able to move condition text along transitions,
- Signals values should be writtable in hexa,
- No check on signals names => should at least refuse "/", "+", and other operators.
- A confirmation message should be displayed when deleting a signal will break an equation.
