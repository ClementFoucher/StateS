// The following behaviors are known.
// They may be buggy, or just uninmplemented code.

- Time line PDF export creates heavy, slow and ugly PDF (unlike machine PDF export),
- Begin/end simulation: machine's colors update is not complete,
- Biggest transition selection box hides smaller transitions when multiple transitions between states,
- Escape key have to be pushed twice to cancel signal creation/edition,
- Signals name at a bottom of a list are partially hidden on creation/edition.

// VHDL export issues

- Active on state state and pulse signals are not correctly handled in VHDL export: signal value is maintained,
- Actions on transitions are ignored when FSM is exported to VHDL,
- Multiple "_" can be generated in a row in a VHDL signal name, which is not a correct syntax.

// Not bugs, but still

- Signals are not sorted anywhere, which can be annoying when there are legion,
- Straight line transitions selection is only done by clicking exactly on the line, so very difficult to catch.
