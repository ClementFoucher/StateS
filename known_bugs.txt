* StateS v. 0.3.8 Known Bugs *
******************************

// The following behaviors are known:

- Time line PDF export creates heavy, slow and ugly PDF (unlike machine PDF export),
- Begin/end simulation: machine's colors update is not complete,
- Biggest transition selection box hides smaller transitions when multiple transitions between states,
- Escape key have to be pushed twice to cancel signal creation/edition.
- Moving machine part graphically does not trigger unsaved state => No warning messages for unsaved machine

// VHDL export issues:

- Active on state state and pulse signals are not correctly handled in VHDL export: signal value is maintained,
- Actions on transitions are ignored when FSM is exported to VHDL,
- Multiple "_" can be generated in a row in a VHDL signal name, which is not a correct syntax.

// Not bugs, but still:

- Straight line transitions selection is only done by clicking exactly on the line, so very difficult to catch.
